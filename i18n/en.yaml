- id: "showcase_description"
  translation: "I am a humble software developer from India who is just curious about everything. I am an avid reader and read mostly fictions and mangas (Japanese comics). Some of my favourites are Dune series (Frank Herbert), Century Trilogy (Ken Follet), Meluha Trilogy (Amish Tripathi) and many more. I am a coffee lover and nothing entices me more than a morning coffee at a quite cafe while reading a book. 

<br/>

I like to watch formula one. I do not travel much but enjoy it whenever I do. My zen setup is me sitting (or standing sometimes) in front of a desk with a macbook and airpods in my ears listening to random LoFis.  I am a sucker for desk setups and PC assembly. Hopefully, I would build an awesome one for myself one day."

- id: "about_content"
  translation:  '<p class="lead">I am a software engineer obsessed with everything computer science. I like to see systems as a whole, from user interactions to servers. I work primarily with server side applications but always visualise a system as an architect. I am applying my artistry as a cloud engineer with focus on containers. I am fascinated with container orchestrators especially kubernetes and also worked as a platform engineer, maintaining kubernetes clusters on hyperscalers like AWS and GCP.
  </p><br/>

<p>In my career, I have worked with various frameworks. Few of them are Golang (net/http, gorilla, go-zero etc.), Python + Django, NodeJs + Express etc. I code mostly in Golang now for server side and shell or python for scripting. </p>

<p>I absolutely love learning new programming languages and explore different paradigms each of them offer. I started with C/C++ during my high school, Java & Matlab while at college and all the way to Golang, Javascript, Python & Shell during my career. I love the simplicity and powerful tooling of Golang but at the same time, admire C++ for its multi-paradigm nature and latest features from C++20.</p>
